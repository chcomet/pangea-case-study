# Abstract  

The apocynaceae family is one of the most medicinally diverse families in the plant  kingdom and is a rich source for drugs that have found use both traditionally and in  conventional medicine. The medicinal activity of these plants was due to the  presence of alkaloids which were either indoline alkaloids or steroidal alkaloids.  The family Apocynaceae consists of tropical trees, shrubs and vines. Characteristic  features of the family are that almost all species produce milky sap. In traditional  medicine, Apocynaceae species are used to treat gastrointestinal ailments, fever,  malaria, pain and diabetes, including skin and ecto-parasitic diseases. Some are  important timber species while many are planted as ornamentals. Non-medicinal  uses include food, poisons, fodder, wood, ornamentals, dye and perfume. A total of  4600 species under 415 genera belonging to the family Apocynaceae were  collected and identified. Species of Apocynaceae have been reported to possess  anticancer and anti malarial properties. Species having cytotoxic activity include  those of Cathar an thus, Nerium, Plumeria, Taber nae montana and Ich no carpus.  Cathar an thus roseus is the most medicinally important plant in this family due to  its use in the treatment of various types of cancers, other agents that have been  derived from this family include the alkaloids reserpine and res c in amine which  have been used against hypertension, and others are the cardiac glycosides.  Keywords:  Activity, apocynaceae, medicinal plants, uses.

are totally dependent on herbal medicines 2 . Human  beings have depended on nature for their simple  requirements as being the sources for   medicines,  shelters, food stuffs, fragrances, clothing, flavors,  fertilizers and means of transportation throughout the  ages 3 . For the large proportions of world’s population  medicinal plants continue to show a dominant role in  the healthcare system and this is mainly true in  developing countries, where herbal medicine has  continuous history of long use. The development and  recognition of medicinal and financial aids of these  plants are on rise in both industrialized and developing  nations 4 . Some contain active ingredients (bioactive  components or substances) obtained from plants.  Through recent researches, plant-derived drugs were  discovered from the study of curative, therapeutic,  traditional cures and most especially the folk  knowledge of indigenous people and some of these  claims and believe of people are irreplaceable despite  the recent advancement in science and technology 5 . In  addition, in the USA, more than   $40\%$   of the population  recently reported using complementary and  alternative  medicines , including botanical dietary supplements. In  the past decade, a remarkable effort has been deployed  

# INTRODUCTION  

Plant is an important source of medicine and plays a  key role in world health. Medicinal herbs or plants  have been known to be an important potential source of  therapeutics or curative aids. The use of medicinal  plants has attained a commanding role in health system  all over the world. This involves the use of medicinal  plants not only for the treatment of diseases but also as  potential material for maintaining good health and  conditions. Many countries in the world, that is, twothird of the world’s population depends on herbal  medicine for primary health care. The reasons for this  is because of their better cultural acceptability, better  compatibility and adaptability with the human body  and pose lesser side effects 1 . From records, most of the  used drugs contain plant extracts. Different types of  plants used to treat various types of diseases that reveal  the most up to date findings in understanding of  biological significance of their bioactive compounds  used. Recently dramatic changes have taken place in  the health care system of world population through the  development of science, technology and medical  science but till to day 400 crores of people of the world  

leading to the isolation of many bioactive drugs from  plants. Generally, the synthetic products are considered  as unsafe while the plant products appear to symbolize  the safety. Nonetheless, the safety, dosage and  potential interactions with standard conventional  therapies are categorically needed because the plant  material could be toxic due the presence of naturally  occurring toxic constituents, heavy metals, toxins,  pesticides, or bacteria 6 . The medicinal plants of  Bangladesh South Asian countries have a large number  of valuable medicinal plants naturally growing mostly  in fragile ecosystems that are predominantly inhabited  by rural poor and indigenous community. In  Bangladesh 5,000 specie s of angiosperm are reported  to occur. The number of medicinal plants included in  the ‘materia medica’ of traditional medicine in this  subcontinent at present stands at about 2,000. More  than 500 of such medicinal plants have so far been  enlisted as growing in Bangladesh Dhaka, Rajshahi,  Syhlet and Chittagong division is rich in medicinal  plants 7 . Apocynaceae  is a large family of  flowering  plants   which  includes  trees ,  shrubs ,  herbs ,  stem  succulents ,  and  vines ,  commonly  known  as  the dogbane family, (Greek for "away from dog" since  some taxa were used as dog poison). The former family  As cle pia dac eae (now known as Asclepiadoideae) is  considered a subfamily of Apocynaceae 8  and the  Apocynaceae has 43 Genera and 170 species accepted  taxa overall. But  Carissa carandas  L(Christ’s Thorn),  Cathar an thus roseus  (L.)  G. Don  (Periwinkle),  Nerium   oleander  Linn.(oleander),  Plumeria alba  L. (pagoda  tree),  Taber nae montana divaricata  (L.) R.  Br ex  Roem .(wax flower),  Ich no carpus frutescens  (L.) R. Br.  (Black creeper) are important plants of this family  because these plants shown different activity for  different diseases. These plants have remarkable  medicinal and traditional uses.  

Medicinal plants are very much related to our health  culture. Most  of the people of Bangladesh are directly  or indirectly depends medicinal plants for health  problem.The review aims to understand the possibility  of medicinal plant  as a sustainable livelihood option.  The specific objectives are to explore the use of locally  produced medicinal plants, to explore the market of  medicinal plants in Bangladesh, to know about of the  habitat, diversity of medicinal plant, to know about the  conversation of medicinal plant, to know about the uses  of medicinal plant against several diseases.

# CONCLUSIONS  

The present study is to explore medicinal aspects of  this family and focusing on medicinal plants and their  local uses for the healthcare. The ethno botanical also  point out some specific medicinal plant species and  their properties to the local inhabitants who are  unknown from value of medicinal plants in the  environment. The use of herbal medicine for treatments  is one component of balancing body systems. In  conclusion, it was obtained that different plant of this  family have showed different activities like antmicrobial, antioxidant, anti-bacterial, anti diabetic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-asthmatic activity, anticancer activity, anti-ulcer activity, wound healing  activity, anti-convulsant activity, biological activity,   anti-diarrheal activity, anti-pyretic activity, pharmacological activity etc. in human being and animal.
