# INTRODUCTION  

Plant is an important source of medicine and plays a  key role in world health. Medicinal herbs or plants  have been known to be an important potential source of  therapeutics or curative aids. The use of medicinal  plants has attained a commanding role in health system  all over the world. This involves the use of medicinal  plants not only for the treatment of diseases but also as  potential material for maintaining good health and  conditions. Many countries in the world, that is, twothird of the world’s population depends on herbal  medicine for primary health care. The reasons for this  is because of their better cultural acceptability, better  compatibility and adaptability with the human body  and pose lesser side effects 1 . From records, most of the  used drugs contain plant extracts. Different types of  plants used to treat various types of diseases that reveal  the most up to date findings in understanding of  biological significance of their bioactive compounds  used. Recently dramatic changes have taken place in  the health care system of world population through the  development of science, technology and medical  science but till to day 400 crores of people of the world  

leading to the isolation of many bioactive drugs from  plants. Generally, the synthetic products are considered  as unsafe while the plant products appear to symbolize  the safety. Nonetheless, the safety, dosage and  potential interactions with standard conventional  therapies are categorically needed because the plant  material could be toxic due the presence of naturally  occurring toxic constituents, heavy metals, toxins,  pesticides, or bacteria 6 . The medicinal plants of  Bangladesh South Asian countries have a large number  of valuable medicinal plants naturally growing mostly  in fragile ecosystems that are predominantly inhabited  by rural poor and indigenous community. In  Bangladesh 5,000 specie s of angiosperm are reported  to occur. The number of medicinal plants included in  the ‘materia medica’ of traditional medicine in this  subcontinent at present stands at about 2,000. More  than 500 of such medicinal plants have so far been  enlisted as growing in Bangladesh Dhaka, Rajshahi,  Syhlet and Chittagong division is rich in medicinal  plants 7 . Apocynaceae  is a large family of  flowering  plants   which  includes  trees ,  shrubs ,  herbs ,  stem  succulents ,  and  vines ,  commonly  known  as  the dogbane family, (Greek for "away from dog" since  some taxa were used as dog poison). The former family  As cle pia dac eae (now known as Asclepiadoideae) is  considered a subfamily of Apocynaceae 8  and the  Apocynaceae has 43 Genera and 170 species accepted  taxa overall. But  Carissa carandas  L(Christ’s Thorn),  Cathar an thus roseus  (L.)  G. Don  (Periwinkle),  Nerium   oleander  Linn.(oleander),  Plumeria alba  L. (pagoda  tree),  Taber nae montana divaricata  (L.) R.  Br ex  Roem .(wax flower),  Ich no carpus frutescens  (L.) R. Br.  (Black creeper) are important plants of this family  because these plants shown different activity for  different diseases. These plants have remarkable  medicinal and traditional uses.  

Medicinal plants are very much related to our health  culture. Most  of the people of Bangladesh are directly  or indirectly depends medicinal plants for health  problem.The review aims to understand the possibility  of medicinal plant  as a sustainable livelihood option.  The specific objectives are to explore the use of locally  produced medicinal plants, to explore the market of  medicinal plants in Bangladesh, to know about of the  habitat, diversity of medicinal plant, to know about the  conversation of medicinal plant, to know about the uses  of medicinal plant against several diseases.
